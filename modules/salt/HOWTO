## HOWTO: running SaltStack

   Why would try SoltStack if you are already using Puppet?  
   If you get to this page there might be a reason, I guess.  
   This HOWTO shows how to have Salt up and running within minutes  
   with a help of this Puppet module.  
   (tested on Ubuntu and CentOS)  

   1. Make sure you've setup salt repository.  
   For RHEL / CentOS / Scientific Linux / Amazon Linux / Oracle Linux:  
   if you have EPEL enabled, you need to do nothing.  
   For Ubuntu and Debian you would need to add saltstack repository.  
   For others, check details on SaltStack installation.  
   
   2. Install this module.  

   3. Add following code into manifests for the host which will act as Salt Master:  
   *(I have it on the same server where MCollective runs)*  

    class {'::salt':
      master        => true,
      minion_master => 'your.salt.server.name',
    }

   Alternatively you can set internal DNS to resolve the name 'salt' to the Salt Master IP.  

   4. Add following code into manifests for servers where you want to pilot Salt:  

    class {'::salt':
      minion_master => 'your.salt.server.name',
    }

   5. Let Puppet do the job.  

   6. Accept keys on a Master.

    salt-key -L
    salt-key -A

   7. If all goes well. You are done.  

   What's next?   
   But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.
